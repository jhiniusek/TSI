We've been working on our project where we make heavy use of the toString override in our classes, since we print things
to the terminal an awful lot. Unfortunately, the Pensioner class doesn't override toString, and is imported from a
library that we can't change the source code in, so we can't use it in our program right now even though it would be handy.
The exact behaviour you might expect is contained within the Pensioner classes getInfo method, but obviously built-in
utilities like System.out.print don't know to use it.

Could you make an Adapter class that wraps around Pensioner to invoke that getInfo method when we call toString on the
adapter object?
